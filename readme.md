Hi! This is one of my most recent and advanced projects. I'll speak a little bit about it here.

By the way, the scanner and the download file are commented out
because they were going to be used for other things but I decided
to not use them for some reason. 

This facial recognition was 'inspired' by justadudewhohacks from github (https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js). I used his api along with some examples 
and references he created to create an application that
takes reference images and compares them to labeled images
then tells labels each person in the image. 

NOTE:
The download.js file was supposed to be used with the scanner. It was supposed to scan the face of
the person using the startVideo function take the frames and compare it to the images of Pharell's 
instagram and name them, but as you can see by looking through the code, it's unfinished. This is because I lost interest in it and I wanted to work on another project.
